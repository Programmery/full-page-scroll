# full-page-scroll
This simple web page that showcases the capabilities of my custom React hooks, providing a multi-directional scrolling experience for the entire page.

DEMO: https://programmery.github.io/full-page-scroll/

This page is responsive, but if you want to test touch screens using Developer Tools, you should reload the page to activate pointer listeners (and deactivate mouse listeners).
